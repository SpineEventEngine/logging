/**
 * A value type which represents the location of a single log statement.
 *
 * This class is similar to the `StackTraceElement` class but differs in one important respect.
 *
 * A LogSite can be associated with a globally unique ID, which can identify a log statement
 * more uniquely than a line number. It is possible to have multiple log statements appear
 * to be on a single line, especially for obfuscated classes.
 *
 * Log sites are intended to be injected into code automatically, typically via some form of
 * bytecode rewriting. Each injection mechanism can have its own implementation of `LogSite`
 * adapted to its specific needs.
 *
 * As a fallback, for cases where no injection mechanism is configured, a log site based upon
 * stack trace analysis is used. However, due to limitations in the information available
 * from `StackTraceElement`, this log site will not be unique if multiple log statements are
 * on the same line, or if line number information was stripped from the class file.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/google/flogger/blob/cb9e836a897d36a78309ee8badf5cad4e6a2d3d8/api/src/main/java/com/google/common/flogger/LogSite.java">
 *     Original Java code of Google Flogger</a> for historical context.

         * unsupported, and in those cases this method will always return the [invalid] instance.

         * layers, consider using [logSite] instead to avoid too much "magic" in your code.

         * You should also seek to ensure that any API used with this method "looks like a logging
         * API". It is no good if a log entry contains a class and method name which does not
         * correspond to anything the user can relate to. In particular, the API should probably
         * always accept the log message or at least some of its parameters, and should always
         * have methods with "log" in their names to make the connection clear.
         *
         * It is very important to note that this method can be very slow, since determining the

         * helper method for `FINE` logging is usually unnecessary (it doesn't normally need to
         * follow any specific "best practice" behavior).

         * whether two invocations of this method on the same line of code will produce the same
         * instance, equivalent instances or distinct instance. Thus you should never invoke this
         * method twice in a single statement (and you should never need to).
