/**
 * A value type which represents the location of a single log statement.
 *
 * This class is similar to the `StackTraceElement` class but differs in one important respect.
 *
 * A LogSite can be associated with a globally unique ID, which can identify a log statement
 * more uniquely than a line number (it is possible to have multiple log statements appear
 * to be on a single line, especially for obfuscated classes).
 *
 * Log sites are intended to be injected into code automatically, typically via some form of
 * bytecode rewriting. Each injection mechanism can have its own implementation of `LogSite`
 * adapted to its specific needs.
 *
 * As a fallback, for cases where no injection mechanism is configured, a log site based upon
 * stack trace analysis is used. However, due to limitations in the information available
 * from `StackTraceElement`, this log site will not be unique if multiple log statements are
 * on the same line, or if line number information was stripped from the class file.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/google/flogger/blob/cb9e836a897d36a78309ee8badf5cad4e6a2d3d8/api/src/main/java/com/google/common/flogger/LogSite.java">
 *       Original Java code of Google Flogger</a> for historical context.
