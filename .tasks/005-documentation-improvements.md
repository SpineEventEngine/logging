# Task 005: Documentation Flow and Typography Improvements

## Priority: Medium

## Description
Based on the documentation typography guidelines, the codebase should be reviewed for text flow issues such as widows, runts, orphans, and rivers in documentation comments.

## Guideline Reference
From `documentation-typography-and-structure.md`:
> "Avoid text flow issues: widows, runts, orphans, or rivers in documentation"

## Text Flow Issues to Address

### 1. Runts (Short Line Endings)
- Lines ending with short words (1-2 characters) or prepositions
- Should be reformatted to avoid awkward line breaks

### 2. Widows (Isolated Short Lines)
- Single words or very short phrases on their own line
- Should be merged with previous lines when possible

### 3. Rivers (Vertical Whitespace Patterns)
- Accidental vertical alignment of spaces creating visual "rivers"
- Should be broken up through reformatting

## Areas to Review

### 1. KDoc Comments
- Class-level documentation
- Method documentation  
- Parameter descriptions
- Return value descriptions

### 2. README Files
- Project descriptions
- Usage examples
- Installation instructions

### 3. Markdown Documentation
- Agent guidelines documentation
- API documentation
- Developer guides

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Review Process:
- Manually review all KDoc comments for flow issues
- Check README and markdown files
- Apply 90-character line width guideline for documentation
- Use 100-character limit for code

### 2. Reformatting Guidelines:
- Break lines at natural phrases rather than exact character counts
- Avoid leaving short words at line ends
- Ensure documentation reads naturally when wrapped
- Maintain technical accuracy while improving flow

### Example Fix:
**Before (has runt):**
```kotlin
/**
 * This method processes the input data by applying various transformations and
 * filters to ensure the output meets the specified requirements and is
 * properly formatted for downstream consumption by other system
 * components.
 */
```

**After (improved flow):**
```kotlin
/**
 * This method processes the input data by applying various transformations
 * and filters to ensure the output meets the specified requirements and is
 * properly formatted for downstream consumption by other system components.
 */
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review all KDoc comments for text flow issues
- [ ] Fix runts (short line endings) in documentation
- [ ] Eliminate widows (isolated short lines)  
- [ ] Break up any rivers (vertical whitespace patterns)
- [ ] Ensure 90-character line width for documentation
- [ ] Maintain technical accuracy of all content
- [ ] Verify documentation renders correctly in IDE and generated docs

## Files to Review
- All `.kt` files with KDoc comments
- All `.md` files in the project
- README files
- Documentation in `.agents` directory (if applicable)

## Testing Required
- [ ] Generate KDoc documentation to verify formatting
- [ ] Review documentation in IDE for readability
- [ ] Ensure no technical information was lost during reformatting
- [ ] Check that line widths comply with guidelines
