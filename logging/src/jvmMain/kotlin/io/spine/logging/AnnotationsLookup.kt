 * This lookup is similar to [AnnotatedPackages][io.spine.reflect.AnnotatedPackages].
 *
 * [AnnotatedPackages][io.spine.reflect.AnnotatedPackages] eagerly traverses
 * all loaded packages during the instance creation. It looks for ones
 * that are annotated with the given annotation type, remembers them,
 * and then allows retrieving of an annotation for the requested package.
 *
 * But as more classes are loaded by the classloader, more new packages appear.
 * As a result, data within the collection become insufficient. An instance
 * doesn't know about every currently loaded package.
 *
 * This implementation performs searching on demand, and remembers
 * the already visited packages to optimize consequent requests.
 * It works because presence of [Package] instance guarantees
 * that the package is already loaded.

     * Besides the general cases, there is a special: different class loaders
     * (within the same hierarchy) may load the same package several times.
