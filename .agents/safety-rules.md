# Safety rules
- ❌ DO NOT modify, create, or delete files under the subdirectory named `config/` in the root of a project.
- ✅ All code must compile and pass static analysis.
- ✅ Do not auto-update external dependencies.
- ❌ Never use reflection or unsafe code without an explicit approval.
- ❌ No analytics or telemetry code.
- ❌ No blocking calls inside coroutines.
